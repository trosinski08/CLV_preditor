# 🏦 Banking Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for banking customers using advanced data science techniques. The analysis helps banks understand customer profitability, predict future revenue, and optimize customer relationship management strategies.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- **Identify high-value customers** for targeted retention programs
- **Predict customer lifetime value** using statistical models
- **Segment customers** by CLV for personalized banking services
- **Optimize marketing spend** by focusing on profitable customer segments
- **Reduce churn** among high-value customers

## 📊 Dataset

**Source**: Bank Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle  
**Size**: 10,000 banking customers  
**Features**: Demographics, account information, product usage, and behavior

### Key Variables:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier
- **Demographics**: Age, Geography, Gender
- **Financial**: Account Balance, Estimated Salary, Credit Score
- **Banking Behavior**: Tenure, Number of Products, Activity Status
- **Outcome**: Customer Churn (Exited)

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation & Cleaning
- Data quality assessment
- Missing value treatment
- Feature engineering for CLV components

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Customer segmentation analysis
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
- Behavioral pattern identification

### 3. CLV Modeling
- **BG/NBD Model**: Predicts transaction frequency
- **Gamma-Gamma Model**: Predicts transaction value
- **Combined CLV**: Lifetime value estimation

### 4. Customer Segmentation
- High/Medium/Low value customer classification
- Segment-specific insights and recommendations
